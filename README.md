# **To-Do List Application**

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add tasks, set deadlines, mark them as complete, and delete tasks. It uses localStorage to persist the tasks even after the page is reloaded.

You can try out the To-Do List application directly from the link below

### **Live Demo:** To-Do List

### **Features**

**Add tasks:** Enter a task and an optional deadline, then click "Add" to save it to the list.

**Mark tasks as complete:** Tasks can be marked as complete by clicking the check button. Completed tasks are visually differentiated.

**Delete tasks:** Each task can be deleted by clicking the "X" button next to it.

**Persistent tasks:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so even if the page is refreshed, the tasks remain.

### **Technologies Used**

**HTML:** For the structure and layout of the application.

**CSS:** For styling and creating a visually appealing design.

**JavaScript:** To handle logic such as adding, completing, deleting, and storing tasks in local storage.

### **How It Works**
When you add a task, it is saved to localStorage along with an optional deadline.
Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking the green check button. Completed tasks will be highlighted in green.
You can delete a task by clicking the red "X" button next to it.
The list of tasks will persist in your browser even if you refresh the page, as they are stored locally.
